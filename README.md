# Credit Card Fraud Detection for AmEx

![Fraud Detection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cfc5ef5-4216-49bc-8e82-461faefc29ff)

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions for American Express (AmEx) using machine learning models. The goal is to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on historical transaction data.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Supervised learning models for fraud detection
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Visualization of fraud patterns
- Handling class imbalance with techniques like SMOTE

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes transaction details such as:
- Transaction amount
- Merchant details
- Transaction timestamp
- Fraud label (fraudulent or legitimate)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization

## 📖 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryadevesh/Credit-card-fraud-detection-for-AmEx.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Credit-card-fraud-detection-for-AmEx
3. Install required dependencies and run :
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   jupyter notebook

## 📊 Model Performance

- The models are evaluated based on:

- Precision, Recall, and F1-score

- ROC-AUC Score

- Confusion Matrix

## 📜 Usage

- Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore data and train models.

- Adjust hyperparameters for better performance.

- Use trained models to predict fraud in new transactions.
